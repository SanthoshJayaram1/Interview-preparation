    // C) Fails! TypeError    D) Fails! Fails!
  
    /* 
    Answer is A) Fails! undefined because promise is rejecting so .catch callback will execute and console "Fails" first.
    In promise chaining .then method below .catch method will be called if in .catch method we are not 
    returning rejected promise ( by default implicitly it returns a promise that is handled by it's below .then method ).
    as .catch method is not returning anything, result of .then method will be undefined.
  
    The Error() constructor creates an error object. Error() can be called with or without new. Both create a new Error instance.
    Error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions.
    Error.message in user-created Error objects is the string provided as the constructor's first argument that is "Fails!" in our case.

    Answer is A) Virat Virat because Object.assign() method copies all own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. 
    It returns the modified target object. Merging objects with same properties overwritten by other objects that have the same properties later in the parameters order.
  
    In the above question, person1 is target object that is merged with person2 and as both objects have same property name
    that's why "Jayesh" is overwritten by "Virat". person and person1 points to the same memory address. comparing person === person1 results true.
  
    Note:- While Cloning an object using Object.assign makes deep copies of data if the data is not nested. When we have nested data in an object then 
    It will create a deep copy of the top most data and a shallow copy of the nested data.  
    
    Cloning an Object :-
    const obj = { a: 1 };
    const copy = Object.assign({}, obj);
    console.log(copy); // { a: 1 }

    Object.assign(target, ...sources)
